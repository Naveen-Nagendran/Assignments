Interpreter - its job is to just analyze and execute the code line by line since Python3 or python is   installed in the system. No high level language is required.\n       Compilor - it's work is to convert source code to machine readable language (High level language),only   then the languages like C, C++ can excute the code.\n       \n 12.   Python is intrepretated language because it will read codes line by line from the human based language to machine readable language.\n \n 13.    Python will be used for big data analytics, app & web developments, testing purpose, machine learning.\n \n \n        \n      ",
